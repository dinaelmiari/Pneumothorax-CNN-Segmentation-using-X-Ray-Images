🫁 Pneumothorax Segmentation Using CNNs on Chest X-Ray Images

This project focuses on the automatic segmentation of pneumothorax regions in chest X-ray images using a deep learning–based U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Pneumothorax is a medical emergency where air leaks into the pleural space, causing lung collapse. Fast and reliable detection is essential—especially in hospitals with limited radiology resources.

The goal of this project is to develop a segmentation model that highlights the exact region of pneumothorax on an X-ray, supporting quicker diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

🔬 Method Overview

The project uses the SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax Segmentation dataset (12,047 X-rays + masks) and implements a full pipeline from preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

✔ 1. Data Preprocessing

To prepare the X-rays for segmentation, the following steps were applied:

Convert images to grayscale

Apply CLAHE for contrast enhancement

Use Gaussian blur for denoising

Resize images to 256×256

Normalize pixel values to [0, 1]

Convert masks to binary

Apply morphological post-processing (dilation, erosion, opening, closing)

A balanced subset of affected and unaffected images was selected to address class imbalance.

✔ 2. Segmentation Model: U-Net

A U-Net architecture was designed specifically for medical image segmentation because of its strong performance on pixel-wise tasks.

The structure includes:

Encoder (Contracting Path)

Conv2D + ReLU blocks with L2 regularization

Batch Normalization

MaxPooling for downsampling

Dropout to reduce overfitting (20–50%)

Bottleneck

Deep feature extraction with 512-filter layers

Batch Normalization + 50% Dropout

Decoder (Expanding Path)

Conv2DTranspose for upsampling

Skip connections to the encoder (preserving spatial info)

Dropout + Batch Normalization

Two Conv2D layers per block

Output Layer

1×1 convolution

Sigmoid activation

Generates a binary mask for pneumothorax regions

✔ 3. Training Strategy

The model was trained using:

Adam optimizer (LR = 1e-4)

Combined Dice Loss + Binary Cross-Entropy

Metrics: Dice Coefficient, Mean IoU

Early Stopping, Model Checkpoint, ReduceLROnPlateau, and CSV Logger

Data split:

70% training

15% validation

15% testing
with stratification to maintain class balance.

✔ 4. Evaluation

The model achieved:

Mean IoU ≈ 0.49

Dice Coefficient ≈ 0.50

Performance is moderate but demonstrates the model’s ability to identify pneumothorax regions and provides a solid baseline for future improvements.

🎯 Goal of the Method

To build a deep learning–based tool that can:

Detect pneumothorax on chest X-rays

Segment the exact affected region

Support radiologists in clinical environments

Provide faster analysis in high-workload or low-resource settings

The method establishes a foundation for more advanced models, such as attention-based or transformer-based segmentation networks.
